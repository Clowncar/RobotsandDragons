	<p>Oh look! You've been lucky enough to find NYC3PO partying in the streets. He is usually seen dancing and doing complicated math equations for the passersby that gawk and take photographs. The story is that he escaped and when attempts are made to capture him he starts telling terrible jokes and it's impossible to get him to stop so they just let him roam. He's not hurting anyone.</p>
